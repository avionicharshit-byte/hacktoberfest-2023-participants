## There are not many rules. The only things you'd have to follow are:
- Do not delete or alter any other people's work or presentation,
- Always make sure to sync this repo with your fork, because it can happen that someone might have commited changes right before you,
- No auto redirects and keep all links target="_blank",
- Pull requests shouldn't be considered as "spammy",
- Be kind and show respect to everyone!
